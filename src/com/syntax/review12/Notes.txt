Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behavior that occurs at runtime, and it terminates the program abruptly.

There are three main types of issues in java programs:
    1) Syntax error
    2) logical error
    3) exception (runtime errors)

1) Syntax error occur when we do not follow the java syntax for example
    when we have to create a variable we must define its data type or use the var keyword
    if we don't do this we will get a syntax error.
    Syntax errors occur at the time of writing code. They do not allow us to compile the code.
     How to fix: use the intellisence (suggestions), IDEs to find and fix these issues.

2) logical errors occur when the programs don't do things that they are supposed to do.
    for example you write some code to click on a button but your program instead clicks on a
    checkbox. you write code to print numbers from 0 to 10 but you program only prints 0 to 9.
     How to fix: use the debugger.

3) Exceptions (Runtime errors) occur
    Are the errors which are produced at runtime. here code compiles fine but the moment you
    try to run your program it throws errors.
     How to fix: Read the error and take the help from the class whose exception is being thrown
    for example NullPointerException.

=================================================================================================
Exception handling:
    is finding and fixing runtme errors and coming up with ways to avoid these errors.

There are some keywords and blocks of code that we can use to avoid these exceptions.
we have 1) try 2) catch 3) finally 4) throws 5) throw

try-catch block:
    helps us test the cod by putting it inside the try block and if something goes wrong
    java executes the associated catch block where we can put back up code or we can
    notify the admins.

In Java, catch and try blocks are used for exception handling, which is a mechanism used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program.
When an exception occurs during the execution of a program, the program's normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) generates an exception object that contains information about the error.
The catch block is used to catch these exception objects and handle them appropriately. It allows the programmer to specify what action should be taken when an exception occurs.
The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. By enclosing the code in a try block, the programmer can handle the exception in a controlled way rather than letting the program crash.
Together, the try and catch blocks allow for graceful handling of errors that might otherwise cause a program to crash or behave unpredictably. By using exception handling, programmers can make their programs more robust and reliable.
